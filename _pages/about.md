ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m **Ying Li**, a researcher focusing on **Efficient AI**, **Large/Multimodal Language Model (LLM/MLLM) Inference**, and **Machine Learning Systems (MLSys)**.  
My work aims to make large models more efficient, adaptive, and deployable on resource-constrained platforms â€” spanning areas from **quantization and dynamic inference** to **AI for Science**.

I am currently based in **Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China**, and affiliated with **Westlake University**.  

**Research Interests**  
- Efficient AI & model compression  
- LLM/MLLM inference acceleration  
- Dynamic and speculative decoding  
- Machine learning systems & optimization  
- AI for Science
